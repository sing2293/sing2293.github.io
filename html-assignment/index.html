            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p1>Hi there! I'm originally from the beautiful Indian state of <strong>Haryana</strong>. I completed my high school education in my home state with physics, chemistry, and math as major subjects. My next journey took me to Kurukshetra University, where I studied animation and graphic design for my bachelor's degree. Through this dynamic degree course, I was able to explore the complex world of 2D and 3D animation and gain exposure to a wide range of skills, from graphic design to video production. Following graduation, I got a university placement, and I started working at <strong>Fotografik<abbr title="Private">Pvt.</abbr><abbr title="Limited">Ltd.</abbr></strong>.I started out as a <strong><abbr title="Junior">Jr.</abbr> Motion Designer</strong>, and my dedication and excellence in work earned me five well-deserved increments over 2.8 years. As I advanced in my career, I was able to leave the company with the esteemed title of <strong>Lead Motion Designer</strong>. Even though it was a fulfilling experience, I became aware that my growth had stopped, which inspired me to look for new challenges outside of my comfort zone.</p1><br>
            <p2>My search for continuous learning led me to <strong>Scaler Studios</strong> in Bangalore, a dynamic media agency. During my 1.5-year tenure, I immersed myself in the world of creating innovative video ads, broadening my skill set and perspectives. Even with these successes, I couldn't help but want more. In an attempt to broaden my expertise, I bravely decided to learn web development. I decided to enrol in the <strong>Interactive Media Design</strong> course at <strong>Algonquin College</strong> in Ottawa, Canada, as a result of this. This programme included Web development among its many subjects, like UI/UX design. I chose to pursue education in Canada not only to learn new skills but also to actively experience life abroad. I wanted to use my skills on a worldwide scale in order to work for a multinational corporation and overcome geographic limitations.</p2>
            <h3>Motivational Quote</h3>
            <q>It's the action, not the fruit of the action, that's important. You have to do the right thing. It may not be in your power, may not be in your time, that there'll be any fruit. But that doesn't mean you stop doing the right thing. You may never know what results come from your actions. But if you do nothing, there will be no result.</q><br>
